# The sound_mmath template library

The C++ library *sound_math* is designed for advanced sound and music computing. It offers a collection of template classes for various sound synthesis and processing tasks. This lightweight library is built to be self-contained, requiring no external libraries, and focuses on providing efficient and flexible tools for audio developers and researchers.

## Features

The *sound_math* library also includes the following tools:

- **pconv**: Fast convolution tool for audio processing.
- **sparkle**: A phase vocoder for time-stretching and pitch-shifting audio.
- **soundtypes**: Generative sound synthesis for sound hybridizations.
- **nebula**: Granular synthesis on sound files.
- **combsyn**: Filter-based resonant synthesis tool for simulating complex resonant structures.

## Installation

The *sound_math* library is simple to compile and install. Follow these steps to set up the library:

1. Create a build directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make


## Requirements

- **C++17 or later**: Ensure your compiler supports C++17 or a more recent standard.
- SoundMath does not depend on any external libraries, making it easy to integrate into existing projects without worrying about additional dependencies.

## Usage

Include the required header files and use the template classes in your C++ projects to harness the full capabilities of SoundMath. Detailed documentation and examples for each tool will be available in future updates.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit issues or pull requests to improve the library, add new features, or fix bugs.
